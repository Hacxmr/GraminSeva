      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>GraminSeva is a voice-first, AI-powered digital assistant designed to bridge the information gap for underserved communities in low-resource settings. Unlike app-dependent solutions, it operates primarily through simple phone calls and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems, making it accessible to users with low literacy, limited connectivity, or basic feature phones. The core innovation lies in its hyper-local, multilingual design. It understands and responds in local dialects, using simple, conversational language. For visual aid, it can generate and send picture-based guides via SMS when data is available.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Healthcare: Symptom checking, maternal and child health information, and reminders for medication or vaccinations.</li>
        <li>Climate & Agriculture: Weather alerts, pest control advice in local contexts, and sustainable farming practices.</li>
        <li>Financial Literacy: Explaining government schemes, micro-savings, and loan concepts in simple terms.</li>
        <li>Public Safety: Broadcasting emergency alerts and information on local rights and resources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A critical feature is a transparent, voice-based privacy policy that explains data usage in plain language, giving users control over their information.</p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>GraminSeva directly empowers users by transforming complex public service information into clear, actionable steps. A farmer can learn how to handle a specific crop disease; a mother can receive tailored prenatal advice; a family can understand their eligibility for a social scheme.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usage Metrics: Call volume and completion rates for different information modules.</li>
        <li>Action-Tracking: Follow-up IVR surveys to measure if users completed the recommended actions (e.g., "Did you visit the health clinic?").</li>
        <li>Outcome Surveys: Partnering with local NGOs to track changes in key indicators like vaccination rates, adoption of climate-resilient practices, or enrollment in financial programs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Scalability is built-in through partnerships with existing community networks—such as Self-Help Groups (SHGs), agricultural cooperatives, and local government (Panchayats)—using a train-the-trainer model. By meeting people where they are, with technology and language they can use, GraminSeva creates a sustainable and scalable pathway to significantly improve health, economic, and social outcomes for millions.</p>
